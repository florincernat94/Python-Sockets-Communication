# Python-Sockets-Communication
In this project I used a client wich connects to two servers. It will provide two numbers for the first server,it closes the first server connection and oppens the connection with the second server, it provides another two numbers for the second server. After receiveing the numbers, each server will become a client and send the sum and the multiplication of the numbers they received to a third server. This last server will then print out the result. This project helped me understand more about socket programming.
